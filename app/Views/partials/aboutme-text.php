    <p class="has-text-centered">I am a 21-year-old aspiring web-developer residing in Cabatuan, Iloilo. In addition to these personal details, I am currently a 4th-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at West Visayas State University. As part of my academic journey, I am currently an intern at the Department of Science and Technology - Region VI. This internship provides me with an opportunity to apply the knowledge I have gained as an IT student while continuing to learn and grow in a professional setting.</p>

    <p class="has-text-centered">One distinctive aspect of my personality is the unique nicknames I have acquired throughout my academic journey, from elementary school to college. Some of my nicknames include Cakes, Biancakes, Bea, and Amor. These nicknames not only reflect the experiences I have had but also highlight the bonds I have formed with my peers over the years.</p>
